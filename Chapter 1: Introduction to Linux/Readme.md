# 🐧 Introduction to Linux

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on UNIX. It powers everything from smartphones and web servers to supercomputers and personal desktops. Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is developed collaboratively and is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## 📘 What is Linux?

**Linux** is technically the **kernel**, the core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources. However, the term “Linux” is often used to describe the entire operating system, which includes:

- **Linux Kernel**
- **GNU Utilities** (shell, compiler, file utilities, etc.)
- **Desktop Environment** (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- **Package Manager** (e.g., APT, YUM, DNF, Pacman)
- **Applications** (Firefox, LibreOffice, etc.)

## 📜 History of Linux

- **1969** – UNIX developed at Bell Labs.
- **1983** – GNU Project launched by Richard Stallman.
- **1991** – Linus Torvalds creates the Linux kernel as a personal project.
- **1992** – Linux becomes compatible with the GNU system → full operating system.
