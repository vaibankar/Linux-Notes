- Job scheduling is a feature that allows a user to submit a command or program for execution at a specified time in the future. On a Linux server, it is important that certain tasks run at certain times the execution of the command or program could be one time or periodically based on a pre- determined time schedule. For example, scheduling system maintenance commands to run during nonworking hours is a good practice, as it does not disrupt normal business activities.
- In Linux, we have three methods to schedule a job

   - at – single time execution
   - crontab – periodic execution
   -  anacron – periodic execution
